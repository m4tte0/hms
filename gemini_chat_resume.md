## Current Status
- A compilation error was reported due to merge conflicts in `frontend/src/components/overview.jsx`.
- The merge conflicts in `frontend/src/components/overview.jsx` have been successfully resolved.
- We are facing a persistent issue where the `git` command is not recognized in my execution environment, even though it seems to be correctly installed and configured in the user's PATH.
- The user will handle the commit for the resolved file.

## Next Steps
- The user should try to restart the environment to resolve the `git` command issue.
- Once the environment is restarted, I can try to use `git` commands again.
- If the `git` command issue persists, I will rely on the user to perform any necessary Git operations.
- Awaiting the user's next instruction.
